  After you finish this program
subquestion: |
  **UPDATE**
  
  After you download your forms, you must file them with the court. This program **does not file** your forms for you.
  
  You may need to schedule a court date for when the judge will hear your motion. The scheduling process is different depending on your location and case type. Check with your local circuit clerk for how to schedule a motion hearing.
  
  Finally, you will need to send your *Motion* and *Notice of Court Date for Motion* forms to the other parent.
  
  To learn more, read the instructions you can download at the end of this program.

  * Not be under a court-ordered guardianship yourself, and

id: previous standby guardianship
question: |
  Has a judge appointed a standby guardian for ${child.name_full()}?
subquestion: |
  A court can appoint a person as a standby guardian. That person will become the guardian once the parents or current guardian are no longer able to care for the minor.
