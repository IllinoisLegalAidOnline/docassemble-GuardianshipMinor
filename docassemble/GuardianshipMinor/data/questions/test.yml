  Legal parents are entitled to notice if someone is asking a court to become a guardian of their child.
  
  You must list each of ${child.name_full()}'s parents on the *${ form_name }*, even if the parent:
  
  * Has died,
  * Gave up physical custody of ${child.name_full()},
  * Cannot be located, or
  * Is unable or unwilling to take care of ${child.name_full()}.

  **Note:**  Do not include parents who have had their parental rights terminated by a court.

  Does ${child.name_full()} have another legal parent?
subquestion: |
  You already entered information about ${parents[0].name_full()}.
  
  There might not be another legal parent if:

  * No other parent is listed on the birth certificate,
  * There is no Voluntary Acknowledgment of Paternity/Parentage,
  * The parents were not married at the time the child was born, and
  * Parentage has not been decided by a court or administrative agency.
